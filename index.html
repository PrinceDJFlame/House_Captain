    <h1>Hi. I'm James Bradley and I'm here to tell you why I should be our House Captain for Edmund Rice.</h1>
    <h1 id="title">So, why should I be house captain?</h1>
    <hr>
    <center>
    <h3 id="Build">I believe I should be house captain because I am smart (I can help you out during lessons), kind (I will talk to you where and whenever), will try to get us football on most days and when we have substitute lessons I will try to make sure we have Mr Ushtman. I feel I could bring our form to a great victory and win us our Dominoes. In Primary school, I was Deputy Head Boy and Team Captain. I hope this has inspired you to vote for me.
    </h3>
    <h3 id="Build">As house captain, I can see a bright future for our Year 8 form. I will take any suggestions about how we could improve the school. But I would personally propose more inter-house sporting competition (for example each house can have it's own football team for friendly rivalries). I would also like to promote fundraising for people less fortunate than ourselves, I believe this is an area that an area we are already strong in.</h3>

    <h1 id="Sign_off">I would like to say that I would really love this chance to be a House Captain and think it could be life-changing just to be able to say, "I was a house captain in High School," when I'm going to University.</h1>
