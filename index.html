    <h3 id="Build">I believe I should be team captain because I am smart (I can help you out during lessons), kind (I will talk to you where and whenever) and will try to get us boys football on most days.
        I'm sure everyone would like a longer lunch and Mr Ushtman as a teacher so when we have substitute lessons I will try to make sure we have Mr Ushtman.
